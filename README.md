# flask_chatbot
A simple chatbot that uses socketio to connect to a flask chat server. The project is part of my child's research expo in AI.

The OpenAI data set was used along with HuggingFace's ConvAI. A description can be found [here](https://medium.com/huggingface/how-to-build-a-state-of-the-art-conversational-ai-with-transfer-learning-2d818ac26313).
A better working implementation of what we're trying to accomplish can also be found [here](https://convai.huggingface.co/).

Models and data have been excluded to the repo due to size. You will need to download and traing yourself.
